# To Do:

Add following functions to the existing ofxPiMapper:

- Soft Edge overlay, so you could drag a softedge blur from the edges of a quad
- Fullscreen quad, select a quad and with hitting a button this quad will go fullscreen
- Remote Control (control the mapping surfaces from another computer over tcp)
- Sync (several RPis with ofxPiMapper will share their timecode to run in sync, maybe based on this: https://github.com/turingmachine/omxplayer-sync
